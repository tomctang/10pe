    "- Fermions: Metals that conduct electricity do so because there is a \"sea of electrons\". This is created from the Pauli exclusion principle, since electrons are fermions, and fermions stay apart, they stay apart.\n",
    "- Alpha Particles: Created by radioactive elements. Since it is slow and heavy, it has low penetration power but can damage biological tissue. Smoke detectors use heavy elements to detect smoke as when there is smoke the current flow between the 2 metal plates that are held at different voltages the current is changed.\n",
    "- Magnetic Fields: These are vector fields that are created by magnets.\n",
    "    - The closer to a magnet you are, the stronger the intensity.\n",
    "    - Normally the arrows indicate where the north pole of a magnet will be attracted to.\n",
    "    - Forces in the magnetic field can cause the magnet to move because of a net force or spin because of forces in opposite directions at different ends.\n",
    "        - The net force can be calculated by finding the axis of increasing intensity and then finding the projection of the magnet onto the axis. When doing this it is useful to keep the south pole of the magnet on the axis.\n",
    "    - Fat Arrows: For some magnetic fields, they can be represented by fat arrows where the width is the intensity of the magnetic field and the direction of the arrows is indicated by the fat arrow's direction.\n",

    "    - This experiment has many variants.\n",
    "    - In the quantum world, since everything is random, the atoms' chance of exiting a specific exit for positive and negative can be calculated using a formula.\n",

    "    - There are many variants.\n",

    "    1. Identify all events.\n",
    "    1. Find all alternative events that can occur.\n",
    "    1. Use quantum rules to find the amplitude arrow.\n",
    "        - Arrows rotate at a given speed(see below) based on the colour of the photon(1 revolution for every wavelength travelled).\n",
    "    1. Add all the arrows together to construct the final arrow.\n",
    "    1. Square the length of the final arrow to calculate the probability for that event to occur.\n",

    "    - 1-3: These are experiments where the photons only interact with air and glass.\n",
    "    - 4-?: These experiments mostly have slits that photons have to get through in order to get detected.\n",
    "- Source-Detector Experiments of Light\n",
    "    1. There is only one event so this is boring. Source -> Detector The length is just 1 meaning the final probability is 1.\n",

    "    - This experiment is strange because out of the two slits, when you calculate the final probability for a photon to reach the detector, it is not the sum of the two probability for single slits like you would expect.\n",
    "    - If you move the detector to where there is a zero probability of the photon reaching the detector and then block a slit, the probability of a photon reaching the detector there increases.\n",

    "    - Intro\n",
    "        - This is an algebraic method developed by Schroedinger in 1940-41 to solve general quantum problems.\n",
    "        - It can solve all known analytically solvable problems.\n",
    "        - There are ten steps for bound states and one for continuum solutions.\n",
    "            - Bound states are states that less energy than maximum of the potential and they tend to be localised in space.\n",
    "    1. Factorisation chain\n",
    "        - We construct a factorisation chain, creating auxiliary Hamiltonians $\\hat H_i$ that we also solve in this process.\n",
    "        - $\\hat H=\\hat H_0=\\hat A_0^\\dagger\\hat A_0+E_0$\n",
    "        - $\\hat H_1=\\hat A_0\\hat A_0^\\dagger+E_0=\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_1+E_1$\n",
    "        - Repeat\n",
    "            - $\\hat H_2=\\hat A_1\\hat A_1^\\dagger+E_1=\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A_2+E_2$\n",
    "            - $\\hat H_3=\\hat A_2\\hat A_2^\\dagger+E_2=\\hat A_3^\\dagger\\hat A_3+E_3$\n",
    "            - $\\hat H_{i+1}=\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+E_i=\\hat A_{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat A_{i+1}+E_{i+1}$\n",
    "    1. Intertwining relation\n",
    "        - For intertwining, we move an auxiliary Hamiltonian past an auxiliary raising operator: $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat H_{i+1}$\n",
    "        - Proof\n",
    "            - $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=(\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i+E_i)\\hat A_i^\\dagger$\n",
    "            - Move $\\hat A_i^\\dagger$ into the parenthesis: $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=(\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+E_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger)$\n",
    "            - Switch order: $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=(\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+\\hat A_i^\\dagger E_i)$\n",
    "            - Move $\\hat A_i^\\dagger$ out of the parenthesis: $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=\\hat A_i^\\dagger(\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+E_i)$\n",
    "            - Substitute Hamiltonian: $\\hat H_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger=\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat H_{i+1}$\n",
    "    1. Subsidiary condition\n",
    "        - Auxiliary Hamiltonian: $\\hat H_i=\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i+E_i$\n",
    "        - Ground state satisfies subsidiary condition: $\\hat A_i|\\phi_i\\rangle=0$\n",
    "            - This subsidiary condition has auxiliary ground state energy E_i.\n",
    "            - We choose $\\phi$ to be normalised($\\langle\\phi_i|\\phi_i\\rangle=1$).\n",
    "        - Recall that $\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i$ is a semidefinite operator, so its smallest expectation value is 0.\n",
    "        - Hence, if we satisfy the subsidiary condition, we have the minimal energy eigenstate, $(\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i+E_i)|\\phi_i\\rangle=E_i|\\phi_i\\rangle$.\n",
    "        - Proof: $(\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i+E_i)|\\phi_i\\rangle=\\hat A_i^\\dagger\\hat A_i|\\phi_i\\rangle+E_i|\\phi_i\\rangle=\\hat A_i^\\dagger(\\hat A_i|\\phi_i\\rangle)+E_i|\\phi_i\\rangle=\\hat A_i^\\dagger(0)+E_i|\\phi_i\\rangle=E_i|\\phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "    1. All energy eigenstates\n",
    "        - Claim: $|\\psi_i\\rangle=\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A_3^\\dagger\\cdots\\hat A_{i-1}^\\dagger|\\phi_i\\rangle$ is the excited state of $\\hat H_0$ with energy $E_i$.\n",
    "        - Proof\n",
    "            - $\\hat H_0|\\psi_i\\rangle=\\hat H_0\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A_3^\\dagger\\cdots\\hat A_{i-1}^\\dagger|\\phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "            - Use intertwining: $\\hat H_0|\\psi_i\\rangle=\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A^3\\dagger\\cdots\\hat A_{i-1}^\\dagger\\hat H_i|\\phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "            - Evaluate eigenstate: $\\hat H_0|\\psi_i\\rangle=E_i\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A^3\\dagger\\cdots\\hat A_{i-1}^\\dagger|\\phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "            - Use initial condition: $\\hat H_0|\\psi_i\\rangle=E_i|\\psi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "    1. Energy eigenvalues are increasing\n",
    "        - We first establish that $\\hat A_{i+1}\\ne\\hat A_i^\\dagger$.\n",
    "        - It is tempting for $\\hat H_{i+1}=\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+E_i=\\hat A_{i+1}^\\dagger\\hat A_{i+1}+E_{i+1}$ to choose $\\hat A_{i+1}=\\hat A_i^\\dagger$, but if we do, then the factorisation terminates at the ith step.\n",
    "        - Proof\n",
    "            - Recall that $|\\psi_{i+1}\\rangle=\\hat A_1^\\dagger\\hat A_2^\\dagger\\hat A_3^\\dagger\\cdots\\hat A_i^\\dagger|\\phi_i\\rangle$.\n",
    "            - But this state is 0 because of the subsidiary condition $\\hat A_{i+1}|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle=0$\n",
    "        - You might think this never happens, but this happens when a potential only has a finite number of bound states and when I use factorisation, it turns out that I can no longer get another bound state in my problem.\n",
    "        - This means that the chain will terminate if I choose $\\hat A_{i+1}=\\hat A_i^\\dagger$ so we can assume that $\\hat A_{i+1}\\ne\\hat A_i^\\dagger$, but the most important thing we need to assume is $\\hat A_i^\\dagger|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle\\ne0$\n",
    "        - Now, to prove that the energy eigenvalues are increasing, we just need to show that $E_{i+1}>E_i$.\n",
    "        - $E_{i+1}=\\langle\\phi_{i+1}|\\hat H_{i+1}|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle$\n",
    "        - $E_{i+1}=\\langle\\phi_{i+1}|\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger+E_i|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle$\n",
    "        - $E_{i+1}=\\langle\\phi_{i+1}|\\hat A_i\\hat A_i^\\dagger|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle+E_i$\n",
    "        - $E_{i+1}=\\parallel\\hat A_i^\\dagger|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle\\parallel^2+E_i$\n",
    "        - Since $\\parallel\\hat A_i^\\dagger|\\phi_{i+1}\\rangle\\parallel^2$ is nonnegative and it is nonzero, it must be positive so $E_{i+1}>E_i$.\n",
    "    1. The superpotential is real\n",
    "        - Ladder operators: $\\hat A_i=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m}}(\\hat p-i\\hbar k_iW_i(k_i^\\prime\\hat x))$\n",
    "            - $k_i$ and $k_i^\\prime$ are wavenumbers.\n",
    "            - $W_i$ is the superpotential.\n",
    "            - We choose the wavenumbers so that the superpotential is dimensionless.\n",
    "        - We now show that the superpotential must be a real valued function or $W(k^\\prime\\hat x)^\\dagger=W(k^\\prime\\hat x)$.\n",
    "        - Proof\n",
    "            - $\\hbar kW(k^\\prime\\hat x)=\\hat B_i\\hat C$, where $\\hat B$ and $\\hat C$ are Hermitian.\n",
    "            - $\\hat A^\\dagger\\hat A\\propto(\\hat p+i\\hat B+\\hat C)(\\hat p-i\\hat B+\\hat C)$\n",
    "            - $\\hat A^\\dagger\\hat A\\propto\\hat p^2+\\hat p\\hat C+\\hat C\\hat p+\\hat C^2+i[\\hat B,\\hat p+\\hat C]+\\hat B^2$\n",
    "            - So, if we do not have linear terms in $\\hat p$, we must have no $\\hat C$ term.\n",
    "            - Hence, the function $W$ is real.\n",
    "    1. Factorisation is not unique\n",
    "        - There may be more than one factorisation chain. We saw this with the SHO, where we found two factorisation chains.\n",
    "        - Nothing in the procedure guarantees uniqueness and we have counterexamples.\n",
    "    1. Wavefunction nodes occur when $W(k^\\prime\\hat x)$ diverges\n",
    "        - Auxiliary ground-state wavefunction: $\\langle x|\\phi_i\\rangle=\\phi_i(x)$\n",
    "        - Subsidiary condition: $\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle=i\\hbar kW(k^\\prime\\hat x)|phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "        - Multiply by $\\langle x|$: $W(k^\\prime x)=\\frac{\\langle x|\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle}{i\\hbar k\\phi_i(x)}$\n",
    "        - Hence, the superpotential diverges when the auxiliary ground state vanishes unless $\\langle x|\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle=0$ at the same $x$.\n",
    "        - Claim: $\\langle x|phi_i\\rangle=\\langle x|\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle=0$ is impossible.\n",
    "            - If we the equation is true, then $\\phi_i(x)=0$ for all $x$.\n",
    "            - $\\langle x|\\hat p^n|\\phi_i\\rangle=0$\n",
    "            - $\\langle x|\\hat p^2|\\phi_i\\rangle=2m(E_i-V_i^\\text{aux}(\\hat x))\\langle x||\\phi_i\\rangle$\n",
    "            - $\\langle x|\\hat p^3|\\phi_i\\rangle=2m(E_i-V_i^\\text{aux}(x))\\langle x|\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle+2m\\langle x|[\\hat p,V_i^\\text{aux}(\\hat x)]|\\phi_ i\\rangle$\n",
    "    1. Superpotential is continuous even if the potential is not\n",
    "        - Suppose we have have a potential that is discontinuous at $x=x_0$.\n",
    "        - A requirement in QM is that the probability density and probability current are continuous. This says that $\\langle\\psi|x_0\\rangle\\langle x_0|\\psi\\rangle$ and $\\langle\\psi|x_0\\rangle\\langle x_0|\\hat p|\\psi\\rangle$ must both be continuous.\n",
    "        - The ratio between them is also continuous: $W(k^\\prime x)=\\frac{\\langle x_0|\\hat p|\\phi_i\\rangle}{i\\hbar k\\langle x_0|\\phi_i\\rangle}$\n",
    "        - Hence, the superpotential must be continuous when the potential is discontinuous.\n",
    "    1. Node theorem tells us we have all of the solutions\n",
    "        - A node is a point where the wavefunction vanishes.\n",
    "        - For all 1D systems and radial problems in higher dimensions, the ground state has no nodes and the number of nodes increases by one for each higher excited energy state.\n",
    "        - We already saw this for the particle on a circle and the SHO.\n",
    "        - Using it, we verify that we have all states with the right number of nodes, and we verify that we have all the solutions of the problem.\n",
    "    1. Continuum solutions have one factorisation only\n",
    "        - We saw for bound states that $E_i<E_{i+1}$.\n",
    "        - One way to see this change comes from the canonical commutation relation.\n",
    "        - This cannot be true for continuum solutions as this would make it discontinuous.\n",
    "        - Hamiltonian: $\\hat H_i=\\frac{\\hat p^2}{2m}+V_i^\\text{aux}(\\hat x)$\n",
    "            - Auxiliary potential: $V_{i+1}^\\text{aux}(\\hat x)=V_i^\\text{aux}(\\hat x)+\\frac{i\\hbar k}{m}[\\hat p,W_i(k_i^\\prime\\hat x)]$\n",
    "        - Because the energy levels change continuously, they cannot have a factorisation chain. Instead, they have a single factorisation(for the particle on a circle, there were two independent factorisations).\n",
    "        - So continuum solutions are solved by $\\hat H=\\hat A^\\dagger(k)\\hat A(k)+E(k)$.\n",
    "        - The factorisation depends on the parameter $k$ and we can do it the same way as we did with the real superpotential.\n",
    "        - Key difference: All of the $E(k)$ are larger than the maximal bound-state energy.\n",
    "    - Conclusion\n",
    "        - These rules follow in a simple fashion.\n",
    "        - We will also develop the whole method further as we use it to solve a number of different problems.\n",
    "        - We will use this to solve isotropic harmonic oscillator, hydrogen, particles in a box, etc..."

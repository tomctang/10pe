# Introduction

**Project Euler**

Jonny's workbook of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Jonny loves coding, especially the PE-style (VS. CS-style) when he was 10YO. Therefore, Tom assisted him with guidance and searching hidden info and knowledge.

**A-level Math**

Jonny already went through 4U math (HSC in NSW) once, after that Tom chose A-level math for Jonny's review and progress, with a approach of computational coding for A-level math.

## Software and files

- We started this workbook using **Python** in VScode: 
    - Python (.ipynb): we start from Python, then we found Python's $SageMath$ - the second powerful CAS (computer algebra system).
- We next started **Mathematica** (Wolfram languages, we will use MMA or Wolfram after): 
    - Mathematica   (.nb): the best CAS.
        - .nb -> .ipynb by [nb2ipynb](https://github.com/Ludwiggle/nb2ipynb)
    - Wolfram notebook (.wlnb): this enables us running Mathematica kernel in VScode.
        - .wlnb -> .nb, 'export to' after running MMA
- Next, more pure FP? Ocaml? F#? Scala? Haskell? 

## OOP to FP

We start workbook using Python in OOP (Object-oriented Programming) way, then we move to FP (Functional Programming) way in both MMA and Python.

Even though both Python and Wolfram are not pure FP, they do help us understand the FP way.

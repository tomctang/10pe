    "- This course deals with permutation puzzles.\n",
    "    1. Swap puzzle(row of 8)\n",
    "    1. Oval track puzzle\n",
    "    1. Hungarian rings\n",
    "    1. Rubik's cube(2x2x2 & 3x3x3)\n",
    "- Why study puzzles?\n",
    "    - Puzzles are the normal persons experience with abstraction and the main idea is that maths deals with abstract objects which we assign to model real world things.\n",
    "    - So to get a good feel of how these abstract objects work, we need to get a physical one and just play with them.\n",
    "    - These puzzles are physical manifestations of abstract objects and they're often built on mathematical ideas and any common person can just go there and pick it up and play with it.\n",
    "    - In this course we learn abstract maths from these puzzles we wouldn't have learned in our undergraduate experience but because these are physical manifestations, these give us a good opportunity to learn this.\n",
    "    - Puzzles also help illustrate and reinforce the fundamental technique of problem solving which is to find a simpler problem you know how to solve if you don't know how to solve a problem.\n",
    "- The main goals of the course includes group theory, theory of permutations, CAS and problem solving.\n",
    "- Group theory\n",
    "    - Group theory is really just the study of symmetry.\n",
    "    - Symmetry is anything that stays the same under some transformation.\n",
    "    - Physics\n",
    "        - Conservation laws of physics are related to the symmetry of physical laws under transformations.\n",
    "        - Modern particle physics would not exist without group theory and in fact, many particles were predicted using group theory before they were found experimentally.\n",
    "    - Mathematics\n",
    "        - Group theory is closely linked to symmetry in geometry.\n",
    "        - Classical problems in algebra have been resolved in group theory(e.g. no general solution to quintic equation).\n",
    "    - Everyday life\n",
    "        - The maths of public-key cryptography uses group theory.\n",
    "            - This is used in online purchases.\n",
    "        - IDs are all around us\n",
    "            - ISBN for a book\n",
    "            - VIN(Vehicle ID No.) for your car\n",
    "            - Barcode for packages\n",
    "            - Credit card numbers\n",
    "    - For fun\n",
    "        - With group theory we can understand puzzles.\n",
    "        - Group theory solved the 15-puzzle problem in the 1880's.\n",
    "        - Sci-fi shows feature problems requiring group theory. "

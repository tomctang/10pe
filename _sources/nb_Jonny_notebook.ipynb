    "My name is Jingzhe Jonny Tang. I am a third-grade student from Epping, Sydney, Australia. My weekly income is limited to just $10, which I earn by assisting my family with making coffee. Additionally, the current exchange rate between the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the United States Dollar (USD) is significantly unfavorable. As a student, I am doing my Year 3 studying at Epping Primary School. As an enthusiastic fan of mathematics, so far I have finished two courses on the Coursera platform, including \"Introduction to Calculus\" provided by the University of Sydney, and \"Applied Calculus with Python\" provided by the Johns Hopkins University. For sure, all of my online math courses are under my parents' supervision. Recently, my dad recommended this course, \"Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects\", to me for the reason that it can help me study hard courses faster. However, it is difficult for me to afford this course. Therefore, I am submitting this application for financial aid. Thank you very much!\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite my current status as a third-grade elementary school student, I have immersed myself in advanced mathematics studies, specifically at the pre-university level. My goal is to prepare myself for a future in which I can pursue higher education in specialized fields such as mathematics or physics immediately after completing my primary education. Here's how the \"Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects\" course and the Verified Certificate will help me achieve these objectives: Academic Preparation: The course covers advanced psychology concepts that are crucial for university-level studies. By completing this course, I can build a strong foundation of learning skills, which is essentially important for mathematics and physics programs at the university level. University Admission: When I complete my primary education, having a Verified Certificate in this course will greatly enhance my chances of being admitted to university programs in mathematics or physics. It will demonstrate that I am well-prepared and have a solid grasp of the complex matter, making me a strong candidate for these programs.\n",

    "Low Income: My weekly income of $10 is significantly limited, and it may not be sufficient to cover my basic expenses or afford any additional educational resources or courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange Rate Impact: As I am from Australia, I am affected by the unfavorable exchange rate between the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the United States Dollar (USD). This makes it more expensive for me to purchase courses or resources that are priced in USD, such as the Calculus Applied course I am self-studying.\n",

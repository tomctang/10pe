    "\n",
    "1. **Problem-Solving Approach**: Questions often require multi-step solutions, testing students' ability to deconstruct complex problems.\n",
    "1. **Critical Reasoning**: There is a strong emphasis on evaluating arguments, spotting inconsistencies, and analyzing cause-and-effect relationships.\n",
    "1. **Data Interpretation**: Graphical, tabular, and situational data are presented for interpretation and deduction.\n",
    "1. **Pattern and Sequence Recognition**: Many questions assess students' ability to identify and extend patterns or logical rules.\n",
    "1. **Abstract and Spatial Reasoning**: Visualization and spatial manipulation are essential for solving certain geometry and tiling questions.\n",
    "1. **Verbal and Deductive Logic**: Logical statements require students to evaluate scenarios and draw valid conclusions."

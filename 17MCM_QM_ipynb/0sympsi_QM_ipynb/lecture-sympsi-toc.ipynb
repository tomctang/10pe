The latest version of this notebook is available at [http://github.com/jrjohansson/sympy-quantum-notebooks](http://github.com/jrjohansson/sympy-quantum-notebooks), and the other notebooks in this lecture series are also indexed at [http://jrjohansson.github.io](http://jrjohansson.github.com).\n",

However, these notebooks will be kept up-to-date the latest versions of SymPy and SymPsi."

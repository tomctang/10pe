# Overview

This interactive SageMath worksheet will explain how to define variables and functions, evaluate and plot functions, as well as finding derivatives and integrals of symbolic functions.  We will use the quantum mechanical wave function of a free particle as an example.

Goals of this activity:

- Plot the real and imaginary elements of the free particle wave function \(\psi(x,t) = A_0 e^{i(kx - \omega t)}\)
- Create an animated plot of the wave function
- Check that the wave function satisfies the Schrodinger's equation

Schrodinger's equation for a one-dimensional system (e.g. think of an electron confined to a nanowire) is \[\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \psi(x,t) +V(x)\psi(x,t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x,t)\].

A free particle is a particle that does not experience any forces along the direction of motion and can move freely without any walls.  In truth there is no such thing as a free particle since all particle are confined in some ways but as long as the dimensions of confinement are much much larger than the wavelength of the particle we can treat the particle as free.  An electron confined to a nanowire with a length on the order of millimeters would be a good example of this.

- All variables must be explicitly declared (except for the variable 'x' and variables used as arguments of functions) using the **var()** command
- Variables cannot start with numbers or contain spaces but they can contain underscores
- Functions can be evaluated by inserting values for the arguments
- To evaluate an input cell in this worksheet, put the cursor in the cell and hit Shift+Enter.  The output will be displayed in the cell below the input cell.

#### What is the free particle wave function solution to Schrodinger's equation?

The general solution to Schrodinger's equation is \(\psi(x,t) = A_0 e^{i(kx-\omega t)} + B_0 e^{i(kx + \omega t)}\) where the only difference between the two terms is the sign in front of \(\omega t\), which determines which direction the wave travels.  For the moment we will only look at the first term by setting \(B_0=0\).

# <img src="sagemathcloud_logo1.png" width="48"> Plotting functions


- To replace variables with numerical values you need to use the **.substitute()** command.
    - To replace all values of the variable $A_0$ with the value $1$, append '.substitute(A_0=1)' to the function name.
- The real and imaginary parts of a function can be obtained by using **.real()** and **.imag()**.
- Since SageMath is based on Python, everything is an object.  This means that you can modify properties or act on things using the "dot" notation.

#### What does the free particle wave function look like?

The solution to Schrodinger's equation must be a complex function so the wave function must be split into it's real part and imaginary part to plot the function.  The free particle wave function for a one-dimensional system is $\psi(x,t) = e^{i(kx -\omega t)}$.  What do you think the graph of the real part of the wave function will look like?  What do you think the imaginary part of the wave function will look like?  (Hint: What is Euler's identity?)

- Assumptions about variables can be specified using the **assume()** command.  In this case we assume all variables are real.

#### Calculate the probability density for the free particle wave function

The wave function \(\psi(x,t)\) is called the probability amplitude of the particle.  The probility density \(\rho(x,t)\) is equal to the magnitude of the probability amplitude squared.  Since \(\psi(x,t)\) is complex, the magnitude squared _is not the same as_ the square of \(\psi(x,t)\).  You must multiply \(\psi(x,t)\) by it's complex conjugate, which is written as \(\psi^*(x,t)\).  The probability density is then given by \(\rho(x,t) = \psi^*(x,t) \psi(x,t)\).

How would you find the probability to find a particle between two points given the probability density?  In other words, how is the probability density related to the probability to find the particle within some region of space?

# <img src="sagemathcloud_logo1.png" width="48"> Defining functionals involved derivatives

Another way to define functions is using Python commands.
- Definition must start with **def** followed by the name of the function and the arguments of the function.
- First line of function definition must end with a colon **:**
- All code included in the function must be indented four spaces (one tab)
- Last line of function defintion must return resulting equation

#### Momentum Operator

In quantum mechanics, all observable quantities have an associated operator.  These operators require a wave function to operate on.  The momentum operator in one-dimension is defined as \[\hat{p}=-i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}\].  The value of the momentum \(p\) is found by applying the operator to the wave function.  In other words, \[p\psi(x,t) = \hat{p} \psi(x,t)\] or, dividing both sides by \(\psi(x,t)\), \[p=\frac{\hat{p}\psi(x,t)}{\psi(x,t)}.\]  Notice that \(\psi(x,t)\) doesn't cancel out the \(\psi(x,t)\) in the numerator because the numerator is \(\hat{p}\) *operating* on \(\psi(x,t)\) which is different than multiplying the two terms together.

The momentum of a free particle is given by \(\hbar k\), which is what the following calculation demonstrates.

# For you to try:

Schrodinger's equation is given by \[\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \psi(x,t) +V(x)\psi(x,t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x,t).\]  In order to demonstrate that \(\psi(x,t) = A_0 e^{i(kx - \omega t)}\) satisfies this equation, you need to plug this equation for \(\psi(x,t)\) into both sides of the equation and show both sides are equal to one another.

First, take the second derivative of the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ with respect to $x$ in the cell below.  Multiply this by $-\hbar^2/(2m)$.  This will give you the left-hand side of Schrodinger's equation.

Next find the first derivative of $\psi(x,t)$ with respect to $t$.  Multiply this result by $i \hbar$ to get the right-hand side of Schrodinger's equation.   Compare this equation to the previous equation.  The two equations should agree if you recognize that $\omega = \hbar k^2/(2m)$.

Use **.substitute(omega = hbar k^2/(2*M))** on this second equation and both equations should match, showing that this wave function satisfies Schrodinger's equation.

# Another exampe of defining functionals involving derivatives

We will use the Python **def** command again to define our two functions.   To define the Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} $ we would use a Python definition that returns the desired function.  We can define the energy operator $\hat{E} = -i \hbar \frac{d}{dt}$ in a similar fashion.  These two functions can then be used to find $\hat{H}\psi(x,t)$ and $\hat{E}\psi(x,t)$

#### Defining Schrodinger's equation in SageMath

The left-hand side of Schrodinger's equation is called the Hamiltonian which you may have heard of in a classical physics course.  The Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}\) and energy \(\hat{E}\) are operators which must have a function to operate on.  In this worksheet we use the hat symbol \(\hat{}\) above the letter to indicate an operator but your instructor may use different notation.  The operator \(\hat{H}\) is called 'H-hat'.

In terms of operators, Schrodinger's equation can be written as \(\hat{H}\psi(x,t) = \hat{E} \psi(x,t)\) where we understand that \(\hat{H}\) and \(\hat{E}\) operator on the functions immediately to their right.

# <img src="sagemathcloud_logo1.png" width="48"> Solving algebraic equations

- When solving equations you must remember the difference between $==$ and $=$.
    - The 'double-equals' sign $==$ is a comparison and is what you should use with the **solve()** command.
    - The "single-equals' sign $=$ is an assignment operator and sets the left hand side to the value on the right.
- The arguments of **solve()** are the equation to solve and the variable to solve for.
- Type **solve?** into an input cell to see the other options available for the **solve()** command.

#### Find the values of \(k\) that satisfy Schrodinger's equation

We've already specified the equation that relates \(k\) and \(\omega\) but the following will show you how to use SageMath to find this relation using Schrodinger's equation.  We'll use the previous definitions of \(H\) and \(E\) along with \(\psi(x,t)\) to find \(k\).

# <img src="sagemathcloud_logo1.png" width="48"> Integrating a function



- The command to integrate is **.integrate()** or you can apply **integrate()** as a function to the equation.
- For an indefinite integral you only need to specify the variable of integration
- For a definite integral you must specify the variable of integration and the limits.
     - For example, to integrate the function \(f(x)\) from \(x=0\) to \(x=L\) you'd type:
             integrate(f(x),[x,0,L])


### Normalize the wave function and find the probability to find the free particle between to points in space

To normalize the wave function, the total probability to find the particle _somewhere_ must equal 1.  Unfortunately with the free particle you run into an issue because the free particle can be anywhere between $-\infty$ and $\infty$.  Using these limits results in a divergent integral.  To get around the infinite integral we will consider the case where the particle is limited to some region between $x=+L$ and $x=-L$ where $L \gg \lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the free particle.

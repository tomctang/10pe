**Project Euler**

Jonny's workbook of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Jonny loves coding, especially the PE-style (VS. CS-style) when he was 10YO. Therefore, Tom assisted him with guidance and searching hidden info and knowledge.

**A-level Math**

Jonny already went through 4U math (HSC in NSW) once, after that Tom chose A-level math for Jonny's review and progress, with a approach of computational coding for A-level math.

## Software and files

While a qualified coder mastering 6 programming languages (PL), how to choose PLs is really a hard decision. 

- We started this workbook using **Python** in VScode: 
    - Python (.ipynb): we start from Python, then we found Python's **SageMath** - the second powerful CAS (computer algebra system).
- We next started **Mathematica** (Wolfram languages, we will use MMA or Wolfram after): 
    - Mathematica (.nb): the best CAS.
        - .nb -> .ipynb ??
    - Wolfram notebook (.wlnb): this enables us running Mathematica kernel in VScode.
        - .wlnb -> .nb, 'export to' after running MMA
        - .wlnb -> .ipynb, see below
- Next, a PL with more FP? Ocaml? F#? Scala? Haskell? Rust? Make a comparison: 
    - 1. PL's Coding-look in defining a Fibonacci; 2. Which FP is best for mathematics? Haskell is NO.1, but I really don't like Haskell; 3. Math-related supports for these four languages; 4. Balance between FP and OOP; 5. Number of users in Project Euler for each PL; 6. libgen supports for each PL; 7. When the PL first appeared. 
    - Decision: **Rust**. We will learn Rust next year. 

## OOP to FP

We started workbook using Python in OOP (Object-oriented Programming) way, then we move to FP (Functional Programming) way in both MMA and Python.

Even though both Python and Wolfram are not pure FP, they do help us understand the FP way.

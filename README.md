> **Project Euler (PE)**

Jonny's workbook of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Jonny loves coding and number theory, especially the PE-style (VS. CS-style) when he was 10YO. Therefore, Tom assisted him with guidance and searching hidden info and knowledge.

PE problems can be solved using multiple approaches and often involve a combination of techniques.

- Sometimes, I face math problems while coding is easy, e.g. 99-Largest Exponential
- Sometimes, I face computational (or programming) problems while math is easy, e.g. 187-Semiprimes (very time-consuming)

So, I need two streams of knowledge to solve PE:

- Math: see **PE-Hidden-Math** where I present math by PE questions and math-topics
- [CS or Programming](https://github.com/leduckhai/Awesome-Competitive-Programming?tab=readme-ov-file)

> **A-level Math**

After Jonny already went through 4U math (HSC in NSW) once, Tom chose A-level math for Jonny's review and progress, with a approach of computational coding for A-level math. In this workbook, Jonny worked on A-level and A-level further which are transitional-math between secondary and tertiary education.

## Software and files

While a qualified coder mastering 6 programming languages (PL), how to choose PLs is really a hard decision.

- We started this workbook using **Python** in VScode:
    - Python (.ipynb): we start from Python, then we found Python's **SageMath** - the second powerful CAS (computer algebra system).
- We then started **Mathematica (Wolfram languages, MMA or Wolfram** after):
    - Mathematica (.nb): the best CAS. Shall we convert .nb -> .ipynb ??
- Next, a PL with more FP? Ocaml? F#? Scala? Haskell? Rust? Make a comparison:
    - 1\. PL's Coding-look in defining a Fibonacci; 2. Which FP is best for mathematics? Haskell is NO.1, but I really don't like Haskell; 3. Math-related supports for these four languages; 4. Balance between FP and OOP; 5. Number of users in Project Euler for each PL; 6. libgen supports for each PL; 7. When the PL first appeared.
    - Decision: **Rust & Haskell** in the next year.
        - I spent one day to install Haskell locally and failed:(
    - Google endorse [Codeworld - Educational Haskell programming platform](https://code.world/) with [Github Repository](https://github.com/google/codeworld/tree/master)


## OOP to FP

We started workbook using Python in OOP (Object-oriented Programming) way, then we move to FP (Functional Programming) way in both MMA and Python.

Even though both Python and Wolfram are not pure FP, they do help us understand the FP way.

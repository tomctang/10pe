    "Physicists LOVE the harmonic oscillator potential.  It is one of our favorites for two very important reasons: 1) It is one of handful of potentials that we can solve exactly and 2) _any_ restoring force potential can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator near the equilibrium point.  This is why we often approximate solid matter as a collection of ball-and-springs; the molecular bonds between atoms behave like springs if you don't compress the solid too much.\n",

One analyzer is slightly closer than the other so that we will know the state of the atom that hasn't entered the analyzer yet because we have measured the other atom's state.

    "- Fermions: Metals that conduct electricity do so because there is a \"sea of electrons\". This is created from the Pauli exclusion principle, since electrons are fermions, and fermions stay apart, they stay apart.\n",
    "- Alpha Particles: Created by radioactive elements. Since it is slow and heavy, it has low penetration power but can damage biological tissue. Smoke detectors use heavy elements to detect smoke as when there is smoke the current flow between the 2 metal plates that are held at different voltages the current is changed.\n",
    "- Magnetic Fields: These are vector fields that are created by magnets.\n",
    "    - The closer to a magnet you are, the stronger the intensity.\n",
    "    - Normally the arrows indicate where the north pole of a magnet will be attracted to.\n",
    "    - Forces in the magnetic field can cause the magnet to move because of a net force or spin because of forces in opposite directions at different ends.\n",
    "        - The net force can be calculated by finding the axis of increasing intensity and then finding the projection of the magnet onto the axis. When doing this it is useful to keep the south pole of the magnet on the axis.\n",
    "    - Fat Arrows: For some magnetic fields, they can be represented by fat arrows where the width is the intensity of the magnetic field and the direction of the arrows is indicated by the fat arrow's direction.\n",
    "    - Magnetic Needles: These are idealized small magnets like those in compasses.\n",
    "    - Magnetic fields are always inhomogeneous vector fields which means there divergence is always zero.\n",
    "- Precession: A rotation that occurs when there is a magnet and a magnetic field.\n",
    "    - Even when there is precession, the projection remains constant as it rotates perpendicular to the axis of increasing field.\n",
    "- Stern-Gerlach Experiment(SGE): Atoms are injected through a region of space where because of a magnetic field, there will be precession. 2 magnets will deflect the atom until it hits the screen where there is a detector.\n",
    "    - This experiment has many variants.\n",
    "    - In the quantum world, since everything is random, the atoms' chance of exiting a specific exit for positive and negative can be calculated using a formula.\n",
    "    - Each Stern-Gerlach analyzer measures the atom's projection on a specific axis. If the atom has no projection on that axis then it chooses a random path to take.\n",
    "    - In the SGE, the inhomogeneous magnetic field's $y$ direction can be neglected because the magnetic field should make the effect cancel out on the sides and since the atom is moving along the $y$ direction, the net force should not change when the position moves along the $y$ axis.\n",
    "    - The force on the classical current loop can be calculated using the formula $\\vec{\\bf F}(t)=\\vec{\\nabla} \\left (\\vec{\\mu}(t)\\cdot\\vec{\\bf B}(x,y,z)\\right )$ where $B$ is the magnetic field(this is the notation) and $mu$ is the effective needle that represents the current loop.\n",
    "- Birthday Problem: The problem asks you that how many people must be in a large room for the chance of at least 2 people having the same birthday to be a specific number.\n",
    "    - There are many variants.\n",
    "- Penney's Game: This is an unfair coin game that seems fair at first. If you pick the sequence of coins first then the other person can always pick a sequence to have a greater chance of winning(unlike the same game but with sequences of 2 coins).\n",

    "        1. If the 3 coins in the middle matches your sequence, you win this round.\n",
    "        1. Continue for as many rounds as needed.\n",

    "    - \"Butterfly Diagram\"($|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|$): This is the outer product and is more complicated then the first three(matrix).\n",

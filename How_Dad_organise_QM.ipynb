    "- M2: Distinguish between events, alternative ways an event occurs, tagging, and measurement; be able to use the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics to describe these different phenomena and how they allow for delayed choice experiments.\n",
    "- M3: Describe how entanglement requires quantum mechanics to violate local realism and how experiments verify that this occurs.\n",
    "- M4: Explain how an interaction-free experiment allows for quantum seeing in the dark and the details of how such an experiment is carried out.\n",
    "- M5: Know the four fundamental operator identities of quantum mechanics (Leibniz rule, Hadamard lemma, exponential disentangling identity, and Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula), in all of their variants, and be able to use them in quantum calculations.\n",
    "- M6: Use the Schrödinger factorization method to solve bound-state energy eigenvalue problems (determining the energies algebraically) and couple it with the translation operator (or the subsidiary condition) to find the wavefunctions; explain why the energy levels are discrete and describe how to use the node theorem to verify completeness.\n",
    "- M7: Use quantum principles employed in the class to explain properties of hydrogen including how to use spectroscopy to measure its mass, the radius of the nucleus, how it is used in radio astronomy, and how the probability distribution of electrons are measured in momentum space.\n",

We discover why quantum mechanics is a nonlocal theory, that it cannot be described by any hidden variables, and that the concept of complementarity governs when quantum interference occurs and when it does not. We also examine phenomena that seem to require faster than light messaging and quantum objects moving backwards in time; we find that neither is actually needed - one needs to think carefully to understand how this is so.
